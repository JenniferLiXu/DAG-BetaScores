#Unrestricted Bayesian Sampling for Bayesian Networks

Bayesian Networks are powerful statistical tools that represent condi- tional independence and causal relationships among variables through directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where edges are interpreted as causal ef- fects between variables. Determining the set of DAGs that best explains observed data is an NP-hard problem. For modeling large or dense net- works, traditional methods struggle or require simplifications that could compromise the modelâ€™s accuracy. In this paper, we develop a novel Bayesian network analysis method that operates with an unrestricted search space. Our approach uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to systematically sample DAGs, effectively inferring network structures that best represent underlying data dependencies. Central to our algorithm is the use of single node scores, which quantify the impact of adding or removing edges between nodes, thereby guiding the sampling process. By ensuring that the search space is unrestricted, our method enhances the robustness of the network analysis, leading to more accurate insights and predictions from complex datasets.

# DAG-BetaScores

The function now distinguishes between two cases for each potential parent node:
- If the parent node is already present in the DAG, it calculates the beta score as
  the difference between the score with that parent and other existing parents, and the score without that specific parent.
  
- If the parent node is not present in the DAG, it calculates the beta score as
  the difference between the score with the parent node added and the score without the parent node.
